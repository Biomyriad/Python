These errors came from trying to iterate over a single obj (class) to
print out the attributes of the obj without using a dot operator.
(turning a class into a dictionary). 

Got it to work to work after only 4 errors.

    friends = Friend.get_all()

    for row in friends:
        for key, value in vars(row).items():
            print(f"{key} -> {value}")

1) TypeError: 'Friend' object is not iterable

2) AttributeError: 'Friend' object has no attribute 'items'

3) ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

4) TypeError: 'Friend' object is not subscriptable
